          <p>Silver Moon is 212 meters long, 40,700 tons and has a capacity of 596 guests. Each of the three ships built for SilverSea are the same size and capacity.

            All 298 cabins aboard the new ship are suites, which is a staple of the SilverSea brand.

            Silver Moon also has the distinction of carrying the "Green star 3 design" distinction, which means the ship was designed, built and equipped to be as efficient as possible in regards to air and water pollution
            Furthermore, 
            the “COMF-NOISE A PAX” and “COMF-NOISE B CREW” are assigned on the basis of the noise levels measured on the ship.</p> <br>
          <p>Cruise ships have packed daily itineraries to ensure that there is always something to do. Behind the scenes tours, food making classes, sports competitions, bingo, trivia, karaoke, wine tastings, and so much more are offered every day.

The activities staff works hard to make sure to make each day is unique with its offering of activities to maximize the fun.</p> <br>
          <p>If activities aren’t your jam, cruise ships also offer the perfect opportunity to unplug and unwind.

While sailing in the middle of the ocean, you'll find the perfect excuse to disconnect from the real-world, and soak up your vacation. You’ll always find plenty of spaces onboard to relax and recharge. </p> <br>
